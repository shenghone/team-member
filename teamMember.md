## Welcome to join Deen Strong, my name is Sheng, I will be the developement team lead for the next 16 weeks. Since it's a 100% remote job, it's crucial to find a way to share code/assets efficiently. I came up with a simple task for you guys to start practicing a version control tool - Git. With the task, you can also get familliar with markdown, which is important when it comes to writing "README" file for the project. For now, we use Github as the platform for code sharing.

### Since we are a small team, it's relatively easy to get to know each other. The task goes like this... I'd like to know a few things from you:

<hr/>

- name (h2 font size)
- job title (h4 font size)
- contact info (bold)
- portolio, personal website or any other social media you'd like to share with others(links)
- current location(regular front)
- say something to the team (blockquote)

<hr/>

### How to submit the task?

- Fork this repo [https://github.com/shenghone/team-member]
- Set upstream from your master branch (the purpose of setting upstream is to sync your repo with the remote repo)
- Create a new branch in your repo(name it as "dev")
- Edit the teamMember.md file in the "dev" branch within your code editor
- Push the edited file to your dev branch
- Sync your master branch with the remote repo (the command you need right now is "git merge upstream/master")
- Merge your master branch with you dev branch
- Send a pull request to the upstream repo. I will commit the changes as soon as possible.

* note: You may or may not experience conflicts during the process, most likely will. Whether it's locally or between your repo and the remote repo. That's the purpose of this assignment - resolving conflits and contribute to the codebase.
* Reach out when you can't figure something out. I'm here to help.

> For the upcoming 16 weeks, you will make mistakes, lots of mistakes. Don't be afraid of making mistakes though. That shows you are trying something new. Don't be afraid of experiment things either. Those efforts will make our projects stand out from the crowd, most importantly, you will learn something during the process.
> As a team, I hope everyone can help each other. If a function can be optimized, but you want to make it work first - leave a "TODO" comment on top to remind other developers and yourself. If you can't meet the deadline, tell me or other developers beforehand, so we can find some time to tackle the problem together. Remember, we are a team. We work as a team. Happy coding :)
